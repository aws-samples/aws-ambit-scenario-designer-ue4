# Ambit Dynamic Obstacle Placement

Ambit provides drag-and-drop tool that enables easy placement and path generation for dynamic items in your simulation scenarios and generate path for them.

- [Spawn Vehicle Path](/spawn-vehicle-path/)

Currently, Ambit only supports generating a fixed path and spawning a single vehicle on it. The functionality sits in Actor **Spawn Vehicle Path**. 

This actor class can be found in the **AWS Ambit** category of the _Place Actors_ panel.
