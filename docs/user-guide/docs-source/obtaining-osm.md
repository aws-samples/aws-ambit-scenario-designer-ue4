## Obtaining an OpenStreetMap File

OpenStreetMap files representing any location in the world can be exported directly from the [OpenStreetMap website](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). 

Note that the number and size of buildings contained in the map area will impact how long the Ambit tools take to process the map. When trying the tools for the first time, we recommend using a map area that is equivalent to a few city blocks square (roughly 2,000 ft. by 2,000 ft.) or smaller.
